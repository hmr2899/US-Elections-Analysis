## Problem 1

A leading news channel CNBE wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. The objective is to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

## Problem 2

In this particular project, I am going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python. I will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:

President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941
President John F. Kennedy in 1961
President Richard Nixon in 1973
